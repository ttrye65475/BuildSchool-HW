              Coworking is not only about the physical place, but about establishing the coworking community first. Its
              benefits can already be experienced outside of its places, and it is recommended

              However, some coworking places don’t build a community: they just get a part of an existing one by
              combining
              their opening with
            </p>
            <p>
              An event which attracts their target group. Real-estate centric coworking spaces are about selling desks
              first, with building community as a secondary goal.
